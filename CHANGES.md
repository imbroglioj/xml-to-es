 * Create index.js to collect API exports into one require.
 * Modify tests and examples to load index.js.
 * API using lib/xml-to-es and lib/indexFiles backward compatible.
 * Fixed bug on --clean, request.delete --> request.del; adjusted tests to exercise
 * Fixed serious bug where attempt to get the mapping was creating the index with wrong settings because of URL
 misspelling
 * cheap-logger ````log```` method now logs absolutely; it ignores log levels
